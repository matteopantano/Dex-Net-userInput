# A Weakly-supervised Labeling Approach for Robotic Grasp Teaching and its Effects on Grasp Quality and Operator's Human Factors

This is the supporting material for the paper "A Weakly-supervised Labeling Approach for Robotic Grasp Teaching and its Effects on Grasp Quality and Operator's Human Factors". Within this repo the code used for fusing the user input together with Dex-Net is provided. Moreover,supplementary materials (i.e., figures, example of test objects) are provided. If you find this work useful please consider citing it.

## Installation

### [DISCLAIMER] Prerequisites for Dex-Net
This repo is a fork of the Berkeley AUTOLAB's dex-net GQ-CNN. Therefore, here we focus only on the modifications for fusing the user input.For Dex-Net documentation and code see [[1]](https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/dex-net/), [[2]](https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/gqcnn/), and [[3]](https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/gqcnn). Dex-Net general information can be find in:

    }

### Prerequisites

The package has only been tested with Python 3.7 on Ubuntu 16.04. We recommend using a Python environment management system, in particular Virtualenv. 

    virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.7 ~/virtualenv/dex-net-user-input
    source ~/virtualenv/dex-net-user-input/bin/activate

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone or download the project from Github.

    git clone https://github.com/matteopantano/Dex-Net-userInput

### 2. Run pip installation

Change directories into the gqcnn repository and run the pip installation.

    pip install .

This will install gqcnn in your current virtual environment.

## Inference

With the virtualenv activated, run from the gqcnn directory execute:

    ./run_DexNet_with_user_input_example.sh

You can adjust the parameters defined in the shell script to point to your own data.

Note that ``segmask``, ``config_filename`` and ``user_input_fusion_method`` are optional parameters.

If ``user_input_fusion`` method is provided, also ``camera_pose_path``,  ``user_input_3d_dir`` must be provided

## Useful material

The objects used for the evaluation are stored under in [`data/objects`](data/objects) and are divided upon object for [`virtual evaluation`](data/objects/virtualEvaluation) and [`physical evaluation`](data/objects/physicalEvaluation). For sake of clarity some figures are reported here:
